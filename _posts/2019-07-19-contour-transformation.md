# Contour Transformation Art Project
## Abstract Proposal

In this final project, we continue to explore futher on one of our past project which transforms a cat into a tiger using cycleGAN. We continue to explore different technique to do the transformation of a cat into a tiger. Our idea is to use HED model to generate contour images of cats, and at the same time, pix2pix model is used to train sketches of tiger. The generated contour images of cats are then used as the input test for the generator of pix2pix tiger trained model.
